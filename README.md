## Instructions

### Running the Game
Open the index.html file in any modern browser (such as Chrome).

Click inside the game area to ensure key presses are recorded.

Play the game!

### Playing the Game
Use the arrows on your keyboard to move left, right, up, down in the game area.

Using appropriate timing, cross the grassy area whilst dodging the bugs to reach the goal area (the river).

If a bug manages to catch you, the player will be teleported back to the starting area for another attempt.
